On a different note, I can access some additional information inscribed into the built-in pearl of the drone. It says it<LINE>was designated to someone by the name of Free Flowing Cloth, A Bale of Twigs, a maintenance worker local to the establishment upon No Grand Ideas. There's even more data hidden deeper within the pearl,<LINE>but it's written in a format I unfortunately cannot parse without time that I lack.

I know you cannot respond, but I still must ask, what is it you're trying to do here, little messenger? We don't<LINE>much time, and I don't see how finding this identification drone helps anyone in this situation. Please don't return to wherever you found this.
