0-DroneConversation
Hello again, brave messenger. Do you know what that device is that you've returned with? It is a citizen identification drone,<LINE>something carried by civilians who worked outside of the limits of rooftop cities for easy entry back inside, but I'm surprised you managed to find one still in working condition. This specific drone is formatted for another iterator,<LINE>and the encoded cipher will not let you enter anyone else's city. Theoretically I could reformat the code to work for the gate to mine, but I unfortunately do not possess the time that would require. I would suggest bringing<LINE>it to my neighbor, who's advanced systems are better equipped for cracking and restructuring data ciphers, but given the current situation, I don't know if he would be willing to.

On a different note, I can access some additional information inscribed into the built-in pearl of the drone. It says it<LINE>was designated to someone by the name of Free Flowing Cloth, A Bale of Twigs, a maintenance worker local to the establishment upon No Grand Ideas. There's even more data hidden deeper within the pearl,<LINE>but it's written in a format I unfortunately cannot parse without time that I lack.

I know you cannot respond, but I still must ask, what is it you're trying to do here, little messenger? We don't<LINE>much time, and I don't see how finding this identification drone helps anyone in this situation. Please don't return to wherever you found this.
