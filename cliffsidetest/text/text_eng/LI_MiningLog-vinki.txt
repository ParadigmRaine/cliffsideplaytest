This pearl contains a outgoing message from Forking Silver Streams, Nine Glowing Brimstones, who appears to be the foreman of a mining facility with coordinates quite far from where we stand.
Now I'm sure you know how pretentious my creators can be, but this is on a whole other level~! This dialect is from long before the Void Fluid Revolution,<LINE>before my forerunners unlocked the true potentials of bioengineering. In more recent times, alloys would be grown from certain strains of fungi or recycled in scrap foundries, but many ages ago, people had to rip metal out from the earth itself.<LINE>I know the process sounds dirty, but my creators respect for the environment did not change even up until their passing. My kind is just one of the many living examples of that.
The outgoing message in this pearl is in regards to the closure of the mining facility and a predicted mass exodus from the cliffside dwellings by the now unemployed miners.<LINE>Many reason for this closure are mentioned, but perhaps the most intriguing one is due to an iterator facility being constructed nearby. Checking the coordinates embedded into this message within my geographical database,<LINE>it lines up with someone by the name of No Grand Ideas. Although I have not directly spoken with him, he has appeared in many Sliverist groups I was researching for my essay on an iterator by the name of Sliver of Straw.<LINE>His opinions towards her are quite disrespectful, and I'm sure he wouldn't treat you other way. Be careful if you wish to return to where you got this.
